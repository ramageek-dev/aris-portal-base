Title: Barcode Generator
Description: This package implements a Web interface to generate barcode images according to well-known barcode formating standards.
Currently it supports the following barcode format standards: Codabar, Code11, Code39, Code93, Code128, EAN-8, EAN-13, ISBN, Interleaved 2 of 5, Standard 2 of 5, MSI Plessey, UPC-A, UPC-E, UPC Extension 2, UPC Extension 5 and PostNet.
The output images generated according to most of the standards have been tested with a barcode reader device to confirm that they are correctly generated.
The classes require at least PHP 5.0.3 due to a bug in PHP found in previous versions that affects mainly the Code128 generation class. The PHP GD 2 extension is also required.
